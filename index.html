<p>Remember this is alpha alpha software and there should not be any more coins in your account than you are willing to lose.</p>

<p>The <code>Multiplier</code> box contains the number your bet will be multiplied by 
The <code>Steps</code> box contains the number of iterations the betting strategy will use until either a) a win is accomplished; or b) the number of steps is exceeded.</p>

<p>The chrome extension uses the <code>bet size</code> to make the initial bet.</p>

<p>If martingale extension will not allow you to place a bet constructed such that the Multiplier, Steps, and Bet Size would exceed your available balance.</p>

<p>If an input box does not have focus you are able to use the 'r' key to run the martingale strategy.</p>

<p>The original martingale script by darby999 is fantastic but will only bet on 1 sequence at a time (through a set amount of losses or to a win)
I had previously used grays bot before finding this one and liked the idea of starting a bot and it will continue running until you stop it or it busts.
So the need to change this one was great. I do not claim to be great with javascript and all I have learnt has been from that fantastic teacher google.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>There is now 2 new features which although may seem a little difficult to understand at first will become easy with a little use.</p>

<h2>
<a name="reset-loss" class="anchor" href="#reset-loss"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reset loss:</h2>

<p>This will lower or increase you bet size when a losing streak hits a certain number. If you wish to run the script as a standard martingale
set the reset loss number higher then the max losses number.</p>

<h2>
<a name="reset-" class="anchor" href="#reset-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reset %:</h2>

<p>When reset loss is called this will dictate the value of the bet. It is worked out as (total balance / 100) * 'reset %' so if you set it to 1
the reset loss value will be 1% of your total balance. Use this with caution and be aware if you add 50% here you will be putting half of 
your onsite balance into one bet then it will start to martingale from 50% balance.</p>
