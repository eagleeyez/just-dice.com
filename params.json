I do not claim to be great with javascript and all I have learnt has been from that fantastic teacher google.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nThere is now 2 new features which although may seem a little difficult to understand at first will become easy with a little use.\r\n\r\n\r\nReset loss:\r\n-\r\nThis will lower or increase you bet size when a losing streak hits a certain number. If you wish to run the script as a standard martingale\r\nset the reset loss number higher then the max losses number.\r\n\r\n\r\nReset %:\r\n-\r\nWhen reset loss is called this will dictate the value of the bet. It is worked out as (total balance / 100) * 'reset %' so if you set it to 1\r\nthe reset loss value will be 1% of your total balance. Use this with caution and be aware if you add 50% here you will be putting half of \r\nyour onsite balance into one bet then it will start to martingale from 50% balance.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nThank you TSavo =) We now have a conversion from balance to USD =) very sexy addition\r\n\r\nlooks as of 28/10/2013\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8c8uwse.jpg\r\n\r\nFeel free to say hi in Just-Dice =) my id is 98066\r\n------------\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
